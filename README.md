## UniBridge – Study Abroad App (Login & Sign-Up UI)

UniBridge is a Flutter-based Study Abroad mobile application.  
This repository contains the **first module** of the project — a **responsive Login and Sign-Up interface** designed with a clean UI and smooth user experience.

The screen dynamically switches between **Login** and **Create Account** forms without navigation, using state management. It is designed to be easily extendable for future backend authentication and social login integration.

### Features
- Login and Sign-Up on the same screen (state-based toggle)
- Custom reusable input fields with icons
- Password fields with show/hide (eye icon)
- Independent controllers for each input
- Text and card shadow effects
- Smooth scrolling with hidden scrollbar
- Responsive layout for different screen sizes
- Clickable Google and Facebook login icons (UI ready)
- Clean and modern design suitable for production apps

### Technologies Used
- Flutter & Dart
- Google Fonts
- Font Awesome Icons
- Material Design widgets

### Project Status
This is the **first project** in a multi-project repository.  
Future modules will include authentication logic, dashboard pages, university listings, and backend integration.

### Future Improvements
- Firebase authentication
- Google & Facebook sign-in integration
- Form validation and error handling
- Forgot password workflow
- Dashboard and profile pages
